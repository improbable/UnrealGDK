# GDK for Unreal known issues

Known issue = any major user-facing bug or lack of user-facing feature that:
1. diverges from vanilla Unreal design or implementation (e.g. ordering of reliable RPCs), **OR**
1. diverges from user expectations from a SpatialOS project (e.g. interacting across worker boundaries)

| Issue | Date added | Ticket | Workaround? |
|-------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| Order of reliable RPCs is not respected in case of unresolved UObject* parameter. | 2018-06-14 | [UNR-363](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-336) | Potential user-code workaround to explicitly enforce the order of RPCs. |
| Dynamic component replication. | 2018-07-03 | [UNR-366](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-366) | Mimic behavior with static components. |
| Schema generator fails when the destination file is locked. The workflow is less than ideal as you can't run it again until you restart the Unreal Editor. | 2018-07-16 | [UNR-350](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-350) | Ensure destination files/folders are unlocked. |
| Server travel does not work in PIE. | 2018-10-24 | | Server travel work must be done with external or managed workers |
| Server travel does not work in multi-worker configurations.  | 2018-10-24 | [UNR-678](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/projects/UNR/issues/UNR-678)
| Gameplay Ability System is not fully supported | 2019-02-01 | | Use the workarounds detailed on the [Gameplay Ability System]({{urlRoot}}/content/ability-system) reference page. |  
| `ReplicateYes` policy on GameplayAbilities not supported. | 2018-10-24 | [UNR-675](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/projects/UNR/issues/UNR-675) | Don't use replicated GameplayAbilities. If they need access to replicated data, store it on the AbilityComponent itself. |
| NetDeltaSerialize is not supported.  | 2018-10-24 |  | Use default serialization |
| Fast TArray replication is supported but not efficient.  | 2019-02-25 |  | Use default serialization |
| Sometimes the player is unable to move when spawning | 2018-10-30 | [UNR-691](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-691) | Reconnect| 
| Seamless Travel is not supported | 2019-01-22 | [UNR-897](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-897) | Disable Seamless travel |  
| Opening the Editor while you are uploading or launching a cloud deployment disables the GDK Toolbar **Start** button, and Selecting **Stop** on the GDK Toolbar stops the running cloud deployment. | 2019-02-18 | [UNR-1006](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-1006) | Wait for the cloud launch to finish, or launch the cloud deployment whilst the Editor is already open. |
| When launching a client from a cloud deployment, it chooses the first **.exe** file in alphabetical order, rather than selecting a particular one. | 2019-03-06 | [LAUNCH-341](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/LAUNCH-341) | When building your client, an underscore is added to the correct executable name. |
| NetMulticast RPCs do not work on Singleton Actors. | 2019-03-13 | [UNR-856](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-856) | Do not use NetMulticast RPCs on Singleton Actors.|
| Replicated TimelineComponents are not supported. | 2019-03-14 | [UNR-1105](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-1105) | Use an alternative method of achieving the desired behaviour, such as playing the timeline on a multicast event, or replicating what is changed by the timeline. |
| Generating schema for `UClass`es that are not explicitly loaded/referenced by the currently loaded level is not supported. For example, a hard coded path loaded at run-time will not be detected by the schema generator. | 2019-03-25 |  | Reference the class explicitly from an already loaded class (Level blueprint, GameMode etc). Alternatively, you can open the Blueprints for soft references before generating schema so that they are loaded into memory. |
| Level streaming might affect performance in certain scenarios. | 2019-03-26 | [UNR-1163](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-1163) | Select the **Query Based Interest Enabled** checkbox in the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Runtime Settings to enable or disable level streaming. If the **Query Based Interest Enabled** checkbox is ticked, level streaming will be supported, but this might affect performance in certain scenarios and is currently being investigated. |
| Changing some SpatialOS settings after launching a local deployment will invalidate the currently launched deployment (e.g. Changing the number of servers, or toggling using Query Based Interest), as these settings modify the launch configuration. | 2019-03-26 | [UNR-1190](https://improbableio.atlassian.net/browse/UNR-1190) | Manually stop and start your deployment after you make any changes that alter the launch configuration. |
