# GDK for Unreal Troubleshooting/FAQ



**Q:** I've set up my Actor for replication according to Unreal Engine’s [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors), but my Actor does not replicate.

**A:** There could be a few different reasons for this. The list below provides some of the most common ones, ordered by likelihood:
1. It's easy to forget to generate the schema for your replicated Actor. Make sure you run the Schema Generator before launching your project..
1. As per Unreal Engine’s [replication documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors), your Actor needs to be created on the server-worker before it can replicate to the client-workers.
1. Ensure that your call to `SpawnActor` is happening on your server-worker.
Validate that the SpatialOS entity that represents your Actor appears in the Inspector. If it doesn't, then it's likely that it's not marked up for replication correctly.
1. Mark your Actor for replication as per [Unreal Engine’s Actor replication documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Gameplay/Networking/Actors). You can validate that your Actor is replicated in `USpatialNetDriver::ServerReplicateActors`.
1. Validate that you receive an `WORKER_OP_TYPE_ADD_ENTITY` for the entity representing your Actor in the `USpatialView::ProcessOps` and that your entity is spawned in `USpatialReceiver::CreateActor`.

**Q:** I've moved my game over to the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal and am getting a crash in `UEngine::TickWorldTravel` when launching a PIE instance of my game.

**A:** Ensure that you have set up your Game Instance Class in your project settings (**Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Project** > **Maps & Modes** > **Game Instance Class**) to point to either `SpatialGameInstance` or a game instance that inherits from `USpatialGameInstance`.

**Q:** Can I change between Unreal Engine’s networking stack and the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal networking stack?

**A:** Yes you can! In the `Unreal Editor`, select the `Play` dropdown from the toolbar, and toggle the `Spatial Networking` checkbox to switch between the two networking stacks.

**Q:** I’m getting the following compilation error when building the GDK: `Error C2248: FRepLayout::Cmds': cannot access private member declared in class 'FRepLayout`.

**A:** You're building against an unsupported version of Unreal Engine. Make sure you're targeting the fork of Unreal Engine that the GDK requires. See the [setup guide]({{urlRoot}}/setup-and-installing#building) for more details.

**Q:** My game uses reliable multicast RPCs - why does the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal not support these?

**A:** The underlying implementation of multicast RPCs uses SpatialOS [events](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#event) (SpatialOS documentation). SpatialOS events can only be sent unreliably. Additionally, the cost of a multicast RPC scales with the number of client-workers present in a deployment, which means they can get very expensive. A better approach would be to send RPCs to only the workers that are close to the broadcasting worker.

**Q:** When I build my project, I get the following error: `Unknown class specifier 'SpatialType'`.

**A:** `SpatialType` is a new class specifier for tagging of classes to replicate to SpatialOS. To stop the error message, rebuild the `Unreal Header Tool` using the `Development` configuration.
