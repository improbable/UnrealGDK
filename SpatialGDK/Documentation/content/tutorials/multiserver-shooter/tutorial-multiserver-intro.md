# Multiserver Shooter tutorial

**What the tutorial covers**<br/>
In this tutorial you’ll implement cross-server remote procedure calls (RPCs) in a simple third person shooter. The end result will be a multiplayer, cloud-hosted Unreal game running across multiple [server-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#inspector) that players can seamlessly move between and shoot across. It will look something like this:

The exercise demonstrates that the workflows and iteration speed you’re used to as an Unreal developer are almost entirely unaltered by the GDK: it’s just like regular Unreal!
