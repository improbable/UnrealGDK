## Multiserver zoning shooter tutorial
<%(Callout type="warn" message="This tutorial is a preview demonstrating early multiserver zoning functionality in the GDK. Please note we do not recommend development of multiserver projects using server zoning at this time. </br>
For more information on multiserver zoning, follow our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and [Unreal features support]({{urlRoot}}/unreal-features-support) pages.")%>	


> **This tutorial uses the Example Project from the GDK's [setup guide]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro).**</br>

<br/>

**What the tutorial covers**<br/>



Following this tutorial, you implement cross-server remote procedure calls (RPCs) for simple first-person shooter functionality in the GDK's Example Project. The end result is a multiplayer, cloud-hosted Unreal game running across multiple [server-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#worker) that players can seamlessly move between and shoot across. It demonstrates multiserver [zoning]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#worker) and looks something like the animation below.</br></br>

The tutorial demonstrates that the workflows and iteration speed you’re used to as an Unreal developer are almost entirely unaltered by the GDK: it’s just like regular Unreal.

**Notes:**

* Before starting this tutorial you need to complete the [Example Project set up guide]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro).
