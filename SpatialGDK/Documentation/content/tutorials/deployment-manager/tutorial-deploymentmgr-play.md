The Launcher automatically downloads a game client for this deployment and runs it on your local machine.

Once the game client has launched, you should see the Example Project start screen

Select **QUICK JOIN** to join one of your sessions or select **BROWSE...** to choose from a list of currently running sessions. 

The default game controls are listed below:

| **Key Binding**   | **Function**             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| W,A,S,D           | Standard movement        |
| Space             | Jump                     |
| Shift             | Sprint                   |
| Left ctrl         | Crouch                   |
| Left click        | Fire                     |
| Right click       | Weapon zoom/ iron sights |
| Number keys 1 - 0 | Select weapon            |

## Troubleshooting

<%(#Expandable title="I can see my deployments in my game client, but I canâ€™t join any of them")%>

If you can see your deployments when you select **BROWSE**  but the **QUICK JOIN** button is greyed out, you might need to add the `status_lobby` tag to the deployments. 

To do this:

1. Open the Console.
2. Select the deployment you need to tag from the deployment list.
3. On the right-hand side of the screen, under **Details**, select **+ add tag.**
4. Enter `status_lobby` as the tag name. 
5. Repeat this for each running deployment. 

When you have done this, re-launch your game client and you should be able to join any of the deployments, provided the number of players has not exceeded the maximum.
