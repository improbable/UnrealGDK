# [Deprecated] Multiple deployments for session-based games
## 6: Play your game

### Step 1: Launch clients with the Launcher
1.  Select **session_0** from the deployment list. This opens the deployment overview screen.
1. Select **LAUNCH** on the left of the page.<br/></br>

1. Select the **Launch** button that appears in the center of the page to open the [SpatialOS Launcher](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/operate/launcher). The Launcher automatically downloads a game client for this deployment and runs it on your local machine. </br></br>

1. Once the game client has launched, you see the Example Project start screen.</br>
Select **QUICK JOIN** to join one of your sessions or select **BROWSE...** to choose from a list of currently running sessions. The default game controls are listed below.
</br>
</br>

<%(#Expandable title="I can see my deployments in my game client, but I canâ€™t join any of them")%>

If you can see your deployments when you select **BROWSE**  but the **QUICK JOIN** button is greyed out, you might need to add the `status_lobby` tag to the deployments. 

To do this:

1. Open the Console.
1. Select the deployment you need to tag from the deployment list.
1. On the right-hand side of the screen, under **Details**, select **+ add tag.**
1. Enter `status_lobby` as the tag name. 
5. Repeat this for each running deployment. 

When you have done this, re-launch your game client and you should be able to join any of the deployments, provided the number of players has not exceeded the maximum.

### Step 3: Share your deployment

To share your deployment: 

1. Open the console and select your **session_0** deployment. 
1. Select **Share** on the right-hand side of the screen to see the Share Application screen
1. In the Share Application screen, accept the terms of service to activate the **Get Share URL** button<br/></br>

1. After you have accepted the terms of service, you can send your Share Token URL to other people so they can try out your game. <br/><br/>
