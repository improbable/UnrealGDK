## Step 3: Build your worker assemblies 

Before you build your worker assemblies, you need to edit the Example Project DefaultEngine.ini file.

In File Explorer, navigate to `UnrealGDKExampleProject\Game\Config` and open `DefaultEngine.ini` in a text editor. 

In your text editor, search for `bPreventAutoConnectWithLocator=False` and change this value to `True`. 

This setting forces your game client to stay offline after being launched until you select a deployment or select Quick Join in the game. 

```
[/Script/SpatialGDK.SpatialGameInstance]
bPreventAutoConnectWithLocator=True
```

Save and close `DefaultEngine.ini` once you have made your changes. 

> **Note**: You must close the Unreal Editor before building your workers. If the Editor is open when you try to build your workers, the command will fail.

There are two ways to build your worker assemblies (known as “building workers”):

- Build your workers automatically using the `BuildProject.bat` script. </br>

This script automatically builds both the server-workers and client-workers required to run your game in the cloud. It then compresses your workers and saves them as `.zip` files to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject\spatial\build\assembly\worker` directory. Use this script if you want to build server-workers and client-workers at the same time. 

- Build your workers manually using the command line. </br>

Use the command line when you want to build your server-workers and client-workers separately, or, if you want to build different worker configurations.

**Note:** Building your workers can take a long time, regardless of which method you use. 

<%(#Expandable title="Build your workers using `BuildProject.bat`")%>

In File Explorer, navigate to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject` directory.

Double click `BuildProject.bat`. This opens a command line window and automatically builds your client and server workers.

<%(#Expandable title="Build your workers using terminal commands")%>

In a terminal window, navigate to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject` directory.

1. Build a server-worker assembly by running the following command: `Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat GDKShooterServer Linux Development GDKShooter.uproject`
2. Build a client-worker assembly by running the following command: `Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat GDKShooter Win64 Development GDKShooter.uproject`

<%(/Expandable)%>

### Troubleshooting

<%(#Expandable title="BuildProject.bat can’t find the path specified")%>

If you receive the error `The system cannot find the path specified. Builds failed.`, open the `ProjectPaths.bat` file in a text editor and ensure that `PROJECT_PATH` and `GAME_NAME` are correct. `PROJECT_PATH` needs to be the name of your Unreal project folder (usually “Game”). `GAME_NAME` needs to be the same name as your Unreal Project `.uproject` file.

## Step 4: Upload your worker assemblies

Before launching a cloud deployment, you must upload your server-worker and client-worker assemblies to the cloud. To do this: 

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to `\UnrealGDKExampleProject\spatial`.
2. Run the following SpatialOS CLI command: `spatial cloud upload <assembly_name>`
<br/>Where `<assembly_name>` is a name you create here for the upload (for example “myassembly”).

Make a note of the `<assembly_name>` you create, as you will need it later.
