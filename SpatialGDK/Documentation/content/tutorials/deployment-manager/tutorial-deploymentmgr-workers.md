# [Deprecated] Multiple deployments for session-based games
## 3: Build and upload workers 

### Step 1: Edit the .ini file

Before you build your [assembly]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#assembly), you need to edit the Example Project `DefaultEngine.ini` file. To do this:

1. In File Explorer, navigate to `UnrealGDKExampleProject\Game\Config` and open `DefaultEngine.ini` in a text editor.
1. In your text editor, search for `bPreventAutoConnectWithLocator=False` and change this value to `True`. This setting forces your game client to stay offline after being launched until you select a deployment or select Quick Join in the game. Your changes should look like this:
    
    ```
    [/Script/SpatialGDK.SpatialGameInstance]
    bPreventAutoConnectWithLocator=True
    ```
1. Save and close `DefaultEngine.ini` once you have made your changes. 

> **Note**: You must close the Unreal Editor before building your workers. If the Editor is open when you try to build your workers, the command will fail.
</br>
</br>

### Step 2: Build your assembly

There are two ways to build workers for your assembly, you can either:

<%(#Expandable title="Build your workers using `BuildProject.bat`")%>

1. In File Explorer, navigate to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject` directory.

1. Double click `BuildProject.bat`. This opens a command line window and automatically builds your client and server workers.

This script automatically builds both the [server-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#server-workers) and [client-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#client-workers) required to run your game in the cloud. It then compresses your workers and saves them as `.zip` files to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject\spatial\build\assembly\worker` directory. Use this script if you want to build server-workers and client-workers at the same time.

<%(/Expandable)%>

or

<%(#Expandable title="Build your workers using terminal commands")%>

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the `UnrealGDKExampleProject` directory.

1. Build a server-worker by running the following command: `Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat GDKShooterServer Linux Development GDKShooter.uproject`
1. Build a client-worker by running the following command: `Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat GDKShooter Win64 Development GDKShooter.uproject`

Use the command line when you want to build your [server-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#server-workers) and [client-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#client-workers) separately, or, if you want to build different worker configurations.

<%(/Expandable)%>

**Note:** Building your workers can take a long time, regardless of which method you use. 

**Troubleshooting**</br>


<%(#Expandable title="BuildProject.bat can’t find the path specified")%>

If you receive the error `The system cannot find the path specified. Builds failed.`, open the `ProjectPaths.bat` file in a text editor and ensure that `PROJECT_PATH` and `GAME_NAME` are correct. `PROJECT_PATH` needs to be the name of your Unreal project folder (usually “Game”). `GAME_NAME` needs to be the same name as your Unreal Project `.uproject` file.

### Step 3: Upload your assembly

Before launching a cloud deployment, you must upload your assembly, which contains your server-worker and client-worker. To do this:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to `\UnrealGDKExampleProject\spatial`.
1. Run the following SpatialOS CLI command: `spatial cloud upload <assembly_name>`
<br/>Where `<assembly_name>` is a name you create here for the upload (for example “myassembly”).

Make a note of the `<assembly_name>` you create, as you will need it later.
