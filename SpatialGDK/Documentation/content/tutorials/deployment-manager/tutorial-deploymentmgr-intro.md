# Example Project: Multiple deployments for session-based games

In this tutorial, you will use the [Deployment Manager](https://github.com/spatialos/deployment-manager) to launch multiple deployments of the [Example Project]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro) in the cloud.</br>


Multiple deployments of your game are useful for time-limited match-based games where you have multiple game sessions with a defined number of players, such as battle royales.</br>

**NOTE:** You can only use the Deployment Manager in the cloud; it isn't available for local deployments.

The tutorial guides you through cloning the SpatialOS Deployment Manager repository and configuring the Example Project to work with the Deployment Manager, before launching your deployments via the Deployment Manager.

Before starting this guide you need to have completed the [Example Project set up guide.]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro)
