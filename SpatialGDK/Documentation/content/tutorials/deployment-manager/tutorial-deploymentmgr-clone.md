## 1: Clone the Deployment Manager

First, clone the Deployment Manager repository. 

Clone the Deployment Manager repository into the parent directory of your Example Project repository. For example: ![img]({{assetRoot}}assets/deployment-manager/deploymentmgr-directory.png)_<br/>Image: An example directory structure for the Deployment Manager and Example Project_<br/>

If you do not clone the Deployment Manager into the parent directory of your Example Project repository then you will have to edit a number of .bat scripts later on in this tutorial.
