## Database Sync Worker Tutorial

This tutorial takes you through how to integrate the [Database Sync Worker Example](https://github.com/spatialos/database_sync_worker) in a GDK project and use it to store persistent data outside of a SpatialOS deployment. 

The Database Sync Worker is a SpatialOS server-worker designed to easily sync and persist cross-session game data (such as player inventories) between SpatialOS and an external database.

This tutorial uses the GDK’s [Example Project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject), where the Database Sync Worker will synchronise players’ “All Time Kills” and “All Time Deaths” counts in a local Postgres Database.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial you _**must**_ follow:

- [Get started 1 - Get the dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies)
- [Get started 2 - Get and build the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork)

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the basic development workflows of the GDK from the "Set up a project" guides: [Example Project]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro), [Starter Template]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/starter-template/get-started-template-intro). 

Additionally, to communicate with the Database Sync Worker, you will be sending SpatialOS commands and listening to events, so a basic understanding of [SpatialOS messaging](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/design/object-interaction) is required. (This is something the GDK typically abstracts from you from you when you build Unreal workers - in this case we will be integrating a C# worker using the [SpatialOS Worker SDK](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#worker-sdk) directly so these concepts are important to understand.)
