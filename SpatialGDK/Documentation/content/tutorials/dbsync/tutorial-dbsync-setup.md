# Database Sync Worker Tutorial

## 1. Set up

### 1. Set up Postgres

To use this tutorial, you must also install [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the database that the Database Sync Worker integrates with. You can download it from [here](https://postgresql.org/download/windows). Once downloaded, set its password to `DO_NOT_USE_IN_PRODUCTION`.

### 2. Set up the Example Project

If you followed [Get started 1 - Get the dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies), and [Get started 2 - Get and build the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork), you will have a fully set up Example Project already. 

For this tutorial, you will use the `feature/dbsync_worker_tutorial_start` branch rather than the default `release` branch. To switch branches, run `git checkout origin/feature/dbsync_worker_tutorial_start`.

Then, open the Visual Studio solution and build the project.

Once built, open the project in the Unreal Editor, generate Schema, create a Snapshot and start a deployment with a couple of players in `New Editor Window`.

As you kill other players, you will see that the score screen has "All Time" columns updated alongside the per-game `Kill/Deaths` ones.

However, if you stop and start again, the "All Time" columns are reset to 0 because the information is not being stored anywhere:

![K/D counts getting reset]({{assetRoot}}assets/dbsync/kd-counts-0-0.png)

The tracking of those stats is done in `DeathScoreComponent.cpp`: you can have a look at the code there and will see the places where you will need to store and read the data from the Database using the Database Sync Worker.

### 3. Clone and build the Database Sync Worker

We are going to add the Database Sync Worker into the Example Project as another SpatialOS worker. To do so, clone [this repository](https://github.com/spatialos/database_sync_worker) into the `/spatial/workers` folder of the Example Project.

Then, in `spatial/workers/database_sync_worker/scripts` run `build-nuget-packages.ps1` (or `.sh` if you are using something like Git Bash).

Once that is completed, run `publish-windows-workers.ps1` (or `.sh`) which will create the executable for the worker to be run locally.

To be run as a [managed worker](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/design/design-workers#managed-workers) by SpatialOS, the executable needs to be packaged in a specific way (described in the config file). To do so, go to `spatial/workers/database_sync_worker/Workers/DatabaseSyncWorker/bin/x64/Release/netcoreapp2.2/win-x64/publish` and zip the whole content of that folder (but not the folder itself) into a zip file called `DatabaseSyncWorker@Windows.zip` and move it to `spatial/build/assembly/worker` (create the folder if it doesn’t exist).

Within the Example Project, copy the `spatial/provided/spatialos.DatabaseSyncWorker.worker.json` file to `spatial/workers/database_sync_worker`. This step is required because the Database Sync Worker uses a different [SpatialOS project layout](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/14.0/shared/project-layout/files-and-directories#layout-of-a-spatialos-project) than GDK project. In the future they both use the Flexible Project Layout. 

### 4. Bringing the Database Sync Worker schema into the Example Project

The Database Sync Worker uses SpatialOS components, commands and events that are defined in `.schema` files in that project.

To communicate with that worker, you need to get the UnrealWorker to send commands and receive events defined in those schema files.

1. Copy the `database_sync.schema` file from `spatial/workers/database_sync_worker/Improbable/DatabaseSync/Improbable.DatabaseSync.Schema/schema/improbable/database_sync` into `spatial/schema/dbsync` (you will need to create this folder).
1. Copy the `postgres.schema` file from `spatial/workers/database_sync_worker/Improbable/Postgres/Improbable.Postgres.Schema/schema/improbable/postgres` into `spatial/schema/dbsync`
1. Because `database_sync.schema` references `postgres.schema`, you need to modify `database_sync.schema`’s `postgres.schema` import statement to look for the correct folder, as such:  `import "dbsync/postgres.schema"`
1. In a console, run the `ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat` tool from `Game/Plugins/UnrealGDK/SpatialGDK/Build/Scripts` to generate the code. As parameters, it needs the source of the schema and a place to create the code. You will be creating the code in `Games/Source/GDKShooter/ExternalSchemaCodegen`:
`{ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat spatial/schema/dbsync Game/Source/GDKShooter/ExternalSchemaCodegen}`. For more information on this tool, including the parameters it accepts, see [this reference page]({{urlRoot}}/content/apis-and-helper-scripts/helper-scripts).
1. Right click on `Game/GDKShooter.uproject` and `Generate Visual Studio Files` for your newly created code to be included in the project.

You've now set up up the Database Sync worker - let's start using it!
