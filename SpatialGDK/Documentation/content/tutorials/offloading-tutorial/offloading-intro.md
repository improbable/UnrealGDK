## Offloading example project

The UnrealGDK Example project contains a map called `CrashBot_Gym` that demonstrates how to offload a gameplay features to separate workers. The scenario in the CrashBot_Gym contains a set of turrets that will attempt to attack any nearby players or AI-controlled bots. The turrets are offloaded to a worker called AIWorker and the bots are offloaded to a worker called CrashBot_Worker. This section will go through the details of what was required to enable offloading in this scenario.
