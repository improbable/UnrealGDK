## Offloading example project

The UnrealGDK Example project contains a map called `CrashBot_Gym` that demonstrates how to set up a gameplay feature using offload to separate workers.

The scenario in the `CrashBot_Gym` contains a set of turrets that attempt to attack any nearby players or AI-controlled bots. The turrets are offloaded to a server-worker called `AIWorker` and the bots are offloaded to a server-worker called `CrashBotWorker`.

In this tutorial, you will go through the steps to enable offloading.
