# Port your project to SpatialOS

### Logs

You can find Spatial log files for your local deployments in `<ProjectRoot>\spatial\logs\`.  

- `spatial_<datetime>.log` contains all of the logs printed to your terminal during local deployments. - There are also timestamped folders here which contain additional logs:
  1. `<ProjectRoot>\spatial\logs\workers\` contain managed worker logs which are the workers started by SpatialOS, specified in your [launch configuration]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#launch-configuration).
  2. `<ProjectRoot>\spatial\logs\runtime.log` contains the logs printed by the SpatialOS Runtime. These are the services required for SpatialOS to run a local deployment.  

If you require additional debugging logs you can run `spatial local launch` with the flag `--log_level=debug`.

### Modify the default behavior

You can modify some of the GDK settings from the Unreal Editor toolbar at **Edit** > **Project Settings** >**SpatialOS Unreal GDK** > **Toolbar**.
You can change:

- the snapshot file's filename and location
- the launch configuration
