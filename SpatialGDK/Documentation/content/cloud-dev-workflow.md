You may find the following command-line snippets useful as reference:

### Build server-worker assembly

```
Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat <YourProject>Server Linux Development <YourProject>.uproject
```

Replacing `<YourProject>` with the name of your Unreal project.

### Build client-worker assembly

```
Game\Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\BuildWorker.bat <YourProject> Win64 Development <YourProject>.uproject
```

Replacing `<YourProject>` with the name of your Unreal project.

### Upload assembly

```
spatial cloud upload <myassembly>
```

Replacing `<myassembly>` with the name you choose to give your assembly.

### Launch cloud deployment

```
spatial cloud launch --snapshot=snapshots/default.snapshot <myassembly> <launch_config>.json <deployment_name>
```

Replacing:

* `<myassembly>` - identifies the worker assemblies to use (as chosen in the `spatial cloud upload` command).
* `<launch_config>.json` - declares the world and load balancing configuration.
* `<deployment_name>` - labels the deployment for SpatialOS to reference in the [Console]({{urlroot}}/content/glossary#console).
