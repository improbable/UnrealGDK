# Actor group ownership helpers

Unlike the [authority callbacks]({{urlRoot}}/content/authority#authority-callbacks), which indicate when authority is gained or lost, when you write gameplay code for a feature using offloading, you might need to query whether an actor or a class is part of an actor group. Now you can use the GDK to achieve it through the `USpatialStatics` class. 

The following table lists the APIs available through the `USpatialStatics` class. You can call these functions both in C++ and from Blueprint classes:

## `IsActorGroupOwnerForClass`

Returns `true` if the current worker type owns the Actor group the given Actor Class belongs to. Equivalent to `World->GetNetMode() != NM_Client` when Spatial Networking is disabled.

## `IsActorGroupOwnerForActor`

Returns `true` if the current worker type owns the Actor group that the Actor belongs to. Equivalent to `World->GetNetMode() != NM_Client` when Spatial Networking is disabled.

## `IsActorGroupOwner`

Returns `true` if the current worker type owns this Actor Group. Equivalent to `World->GetNetMode() != NM_Client` when Spatial Networking is disabled.
