# Principles of the GDK for Unreal

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is a plugin which allows you to use the features of SpatialOS while developing with familiar Unreal Engine workflows and APIs.

* **Unreal-first**

    We want experienced Unreal developers to benefit from the features of Unreal and take advantage of the SpatialOS platform, with a workflow that’s as native to Unreal as possible. 

    To achieve this, we’ve created a version of Unreal Engine which provides SpatialOS networking alongside Unreal’s native networking. We maintain Unreal’s networking API, which means you don’t need to rewrite your game to make it work with the GDK.</br></br>

* **No limits**
    
    An Unreal dedicated server is only as powerful as the single machine running it. The single machine quickly becomes a bottleneck in games with high numbers of Actors or complex game logic. 

    You don’t have to make these technical tradeoffs with the GDK. SpatialOS can spread computation across multiple servers, allowing for far more complex games and much higher player counts.</br></br>

* **Open development**
    
    The GDK is a community-driven project. We do all our development in the open and under an [MIT license](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/blob/release/LICENSE.md).

    We value your contributions (see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) and feature requests. Get in touch on the [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/tags/unreal-gdk) or on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/RFB8S8C).
