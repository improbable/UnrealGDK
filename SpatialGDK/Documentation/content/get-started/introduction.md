# Get started
## Introduction

Get started with the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal by building the GDK's Unreal Engine Fork and setting up a project. You can set up either or both of the following projects: </br>

* **The Example Project** is a session-based FPS game. It gives an overview of the GDK and using SpatialOS, including deploying your game to SpatialOS in the cloud and on your development machine -  useful for testing during development.

* **The Starter Template** is a template project you can use as a base to create your own new project running on SpatialOS.

After you set up with the Example Project or Starter Template, you can check out the following tutorials and guides:

* **Tutorial on multiple deployments for session-based games**: </br>
Use the Deployment Manager to launch multiple deployments of the Example Project in the cloud - useful for time-limited match-based games, such as battle royales.
</br>
</br>
* **The multiserver zoning shooter tutorial**: </br>
Learn more about the the GDK's functionality by implementing shooting across the boundaries of different servers computing one game world. In this tutorial, you will set up a new game; the Mutliserver Shooter Game.
</br>
</br>
* **The porting guide**: <br/>
Port your existing UE project to SpatialOS.
