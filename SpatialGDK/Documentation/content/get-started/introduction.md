# Get started: Introduction

Get started with the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal by building the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork and setting up the GDK Starter Template which you can use as a base for your own project running on SpatialOS.

After this you can either:

* Follow the Multiserver Shooter Tutorial, which shows you how to deploy a project to the cloud and demonstrates a simple shooter game running across two servers.
* Or, if you have an existing Unreal multiplayer project, you can follow the porting guide to get your game running on  the SpatialOS GDK.
