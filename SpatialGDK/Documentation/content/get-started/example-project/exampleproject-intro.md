# Get started
## 3 - Set up a project: The Example Project 

This guide takes you through setting up the [Example project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject); you will launch a single-server local deployment to test the project on your development machine, and you will launch a single-server deployment in the cloud to test and share the project. 

The project contains gameplay and assets that are representative of a basic first-person shooter running on SpatialOS. If you want to make your own project from scratch, use the [Starter Template]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/starter-template/get-started-template-intro).

Before starting this tutorial you _**must**_ follow:

- [Get started 1 - Get the dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies)
- [Get started 2 - Get and build the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork)

If you used the **InstallGDK.bat** script to build your Unreal Engine Fork then, you can skip  **1: Set up** and follow the steps below

#### 1: Set up post InstallGDK.bat
To build the GDK Example Project, you need to:

1. In the directory `UnrealEngine\samples\UnrealGDKExampleProject\Game`, double-click **GDKShooter.sln** to open it with Visual Studio.
1. In the Solution Explorer window, right-click on **GDKShooter** and select **Build**.
1. When Visual Studio has finished building your project, right-click on **GDKShooter** and select **Set as StartUp Project**.
1. In the same directory open Example project, by double-clicking on **GDKShooter.uproject**.
1. Go to [2: Launch a local deployment]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-local-deployment). 

**If you manually built your Engine Fork**, or if you want to download and set up the Example Project manually.  
Follow [1: Set up]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-setup)

**> Next:** [1: Set up]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-setup)
