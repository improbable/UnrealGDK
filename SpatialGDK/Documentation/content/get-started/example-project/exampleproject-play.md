In the Console, Select **Launch** on the left of the page. Then, select the **Launch** button that appears in the center of the page to open the SpatialOS Launcher. The Launcher automatically downloads the game client for this deployment and runs it on your local machine.

<%(#Expandable title="What is the SpatialOS Launcher?")%>

The Launcher is a distribution tool which downloads and launches game clients for your deployment. You access the Launcher from the Console; use the Console to create a URL to give end-users access to a game client for your game.

Once the client has launched, enter a name for your player character and select **Start** to start playing. <br/>
