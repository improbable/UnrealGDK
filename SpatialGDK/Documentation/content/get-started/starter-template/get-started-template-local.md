## 2.  Launch a local deployment with multiple clients

When you want to try out your game, you need to run a deployment. 

There are two types of deployment: local and cloud.

* A [local deployment]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#deployment) launches your game with its own instance of SpatialOS, running on your development machine. 
* A [Cloud deployments]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#deployment) runs in the cloud on [nodes]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#node). A node refers to a single machine used by a cloud deployment. When you have deployed your game, you can share it with other people and run your game at a scale not possible on a single machine. Once a cloud deployment is running, you can connect clients to it using the [Launcher]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#launcher).

> * For small-scale tests, use local deployments to quickly test and iterate on changes to your project. 
> * For large-scale tests with several players, use a cloud deployment.

### Step 1: Generate schema and a snapshot

Before you launch a deployment (local or cloud) you must generate [schema]({{urlRoot}}/content/spatialos-concepts/schema-and-snapshots#schema) and a [snapshot]({{urlRoot}}/content/spatialos-concepts/schema-and-snapshots#snapshots). 

1. In the Editor, on the [GDK Toolbar]({{urlRoot}}/content/toolbars), open the **Schema** drop-down menu and select **Schema (Full Scan)**. <br/>

   </br>
1. Select **Snapshot** to generate a snapshot.<br/>

<%(#Expandable title="What is Schema?")%>

Schema is a set of definitions which represent your game’s objects in SpatialOS as SpatialOS entities. Schema is defined in .schema files and written in schemalang. When you use the GDK, the schema files and their contents are generated automatically so you do not have to write or edit schema files manually.

You can find out more about schema in the [GDK schema documentation]({{urlRoot}}/content/how-to-use-schema)

<%(#Expandable title="What is a SpatialOS entity?")%>
A SpatialOS entity (usually just called an “entity”) is the SpatialOS equivalent of  an Unreal Actor. It’s made up of a set of SpatialOS components. Each component stores data about the entity. (Note that SpatialOS components are not the same thing as Unreal Components.)
<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="What is  a snapshot?")%>

A snapshot is a representation of the state of a SpatialOS world at a given point in time. A snapshot stores the current state of each entity’s component data. You start each deployment with a snapshot; if it’s a re-deployment of an existing game, you can use the snapshot you originally started your deployment with, or use a snapshot that contains the exact state of a deployment before you stopped it.

You can find out more about snapshots in the [GDK snapshot documentation]({{urlRoot}}/content/how-to-use-snapshots).

### Step 2: Launch a local deployment

This section shows you how to  start one SpatialOS server-worker instance and two SpatialOS client-worker instances locally, in your Unreal Editor. The server-worker instance acts as an Unreal server and the two client-worker instances acts as two Unreal game clients (as would be used by two game players). 

1. On the GDK toolbar, Select **Start**. This opens a comamnd line window and starts a local SpatialOS deployment. Wait until you see the output `SpatialOS ready` in your command line window.<br/>
   ![Toolbar]({{assetRoot}}assets/screen-grabs/toolbar/start-button.png)<br/>
   _Image: On the GDK toolbar in the Unreal Editor select **Start**_<br/>
1. On the Unreal Editor toolbar, open the **Play** drop-down menu.
1. Under **Multiplayer Options**, set the number of players to **2** and ensure that the check box next to **Run Dedicated Server** is selected.<br/>

   _Image: The Unreal Engine **Play** drop-down menu, with **Multiplayer Options** and **New Editor Window (PIE)** highlighted_<br/>
1. Under **Modes**, select **New Editor Window (PIE)** to run the game.  You should see two clients start. You can switch between two Editor windows to see and interact with each game client.
	If the game does not run automatically after selecting **New Editor Window (PIE)**, on the Editor toolbar, select **Play** to run the game.

1. When your game is running, select **Inspector** to open the [Inspector](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/alpha//content/glossary#inspector) in your default web browser. The Inspector is a web-based tool that you use to explore the internal state of a SpatialOS world. It gives you a real-time view of what’s happening in a local or cloud deployment. <br/>
    ![]({{assetRoot}}assets/screen-grabs/toolbar/inspector-button.png)<br/>_Image: On the Unreal Engine toolbar, select Inspector_<br/>
    ![]({{assetRoot}}assets/set-up-template/template-two-client-inspector.png)<br/>

1. When you're done, select **Stop** in the GDK toolbar to stop your local SpatialOS deployment.<br/>![Toolbar]({{assetRoot}}assets/screen-grabs/toolbar/stop-button.png)<br/>
   _Image: On the GDK toolbar in the Unreal Editor select **Stop**_<br/>

  <%(#Expandable title="What is the Inspector?")%> The Inspector is a browser-based tool that you use to explore the internal state of a game's SpatialOS world. It gives you a real-time view of what’s happening in a local or cloud deployment. <br/>
  The Inspector we are using here is looking at a local deployment running on your computer and not in the cloud, so we use a local URL for the Inspector as it's also running locally on your computer. When running locally, the Inspector automatically downloads and caches the latest Inspector client from the internet. When you use the Inspector in a cloud deployment, you access the Inspector through the Console via the web at https://console.improbable.io.
