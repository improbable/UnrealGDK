## 3 - Set up a project: The Starter Template

# Introduction

If you are ready to start developing your own game with the GDK, follow the steps below to create a new project.

- Before setting up the SpatialOS GDK Starter Template, you _**must**_ follow:
  - [Get started 1 - Dependencies]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies)
  - [Get started 2 - Get and build the SpatialOS Unreal Engine Fork]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/build-unreal-fork)
- We recommend setting up the [Example Project]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro) before creating a new project. This gives you an overview of the GDK and using SpatialOS.
