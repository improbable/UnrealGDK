# Helper scripts

These scripts are located under `Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\` directory of your game.

| Helper script | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BuildWorker.bat` | `<target> <platform> <configuration> <YourGame>.uproject [--skip-codegen]` | Example: </br> `BuildWorker.bat ExampleGameEditor Win64 Development ExampleGame.uproject` </br></br> Build, cook and zip your Unreal server-workers and client-workers for use with a SpatialOS cloud deployment (uploaded using [`spatial cloud upload`](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/deploy/deploy-cloud)). </br></br>  The following `<target>`s  generate zipped workers: </br> - `<YourGame>` </br> - `<YourGame>Server` </br> - `<YourGame>Editor` </br></br> Any other `<target>` passes all arguments to `Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat` with no cooking or zipping performed.|
| `ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat` | `<schema_directory> <output_code_directory>` | Use this script to generate Unreal code from handwritten SpatialOS schema to enable Unreal game code to interop with [non-Unreal server-worker types]({{urlRoot}}/content/non-unreal-server-worker-types). </br></br>**Example:** </br> `ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat spatial\schema\my_external_schema Game\Source\ThirdPersonShooter\ExternalSchemaCodegen` </br></br> Running this script forwards the arguments to a code generator binary executable within the GDK which is created by the `Setup.bat` script.  The binary uses user-defined SpatialOS [schema]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#schema) to generate Unreal C++ types and interface for sending and registering callbacks for receiving SpatialOS component updates. Both flags are defined relative to the project root.</br></br> **Flags:** </br> * `<schema_directory>` is a subdirectory of the `spatial\schema` folder that is created by the user and contains schema files that are handwritten by the user (and not schema files generated by the GDK). </br> * `<output_code_directory>` is an output directory for the code generated by the binary.|
