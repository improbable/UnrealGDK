# Helper scripts

These scripts are located under `Plugins\UnrealGDK\SpatialGDK\Build\Scripts\` directory of your game.

| Helper script | Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BuildWorker.bat` | `<target> <platform> <configuration> <YourGame>.uproject [--skip-codegen]` | Run this script from the command line to [build your game’s Unreal server-workers and client-workers]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#workers) ready for uploading as a SpatialOS [cloud deployment]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#deployment) or set them up for testing in a local deployment in the Unreal Editor on your development machine. <br/><br/> Some parameters also [cook](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Deployment/Cooking) your workers to Unreal format and zip them up. (A SpatialOS cloud deployment requires built workers in zipped files.) <br/><br/> (In the example and list below, `<YourGame>` is the name of your Unreal project.) </br></br>**Example**</br> `BuildWorker.bat <YourGame>Editor Win64 Development <YourGame>.uproject` </br></br> **Flags** </br> **`<target>`**</br> This is the output file the built workers are stored in. They are [Unreal’s build target](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/TargetFiles) files. The target can be: </br> * `<YourGame>Editor`: Set up server-workers for a local deployment for testing in the Unreal Editor on your development machine. This option does not cook or zip server-workers as this is not needed for local deployments. </br> * `<YourGame>Server`: Build, cook and zip server-workers ready for upload to the SpatialOS cloud as a cloud deployment. </br> * `<YourGame>`: Cooks a stand-alone version of the game to test it as a game client. </br></br> If you specify other Unreal  `<target>`, this script passes all arguments to the UE script, `\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat`with no cooking or zipping. </br></br> **`<platform>`**</br> Specify the platform your built server-worker or game client to runs on. This is:</br> *  `linux` for your server-workers </br> * `win64` for you game client exectuable </br></br> **`<configuration>`**</br> Use the [Unreal build configuration](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Development/BuildConfigurations) `Development` which is the one you usually use during game development. </br></br>* `--skip-codegen` is optional, add this if you want the build script to _NOT_ generate [schema]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#schema-generation). |

| `ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat` | `<schema_directory> <output_code_directory>` | If you create [non-Unreal server-worker types]({{urlRoot}}/content/non-unreal-server-worker-types), using the [SpatialOS Worker SDK](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.8/shared/sdks-and-data-overview) outside of the GDK and your Unreal Engine, you manually create [schema]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#schema). Use this script to generate Unreal code from manually-created schema; it enables your Unreal game code to interoperate with non-Unreal server-worker types. </br></br>**Example:** </br> `ExternalSchemaCodegen.bat spatial\schema\my_external_schema Game\Source\ThirdPersonShooter\ExternalSchemaCodegen` </br></br> The script forwards its arguments to a code-generator binary executable within the GDK; the binary was created by the `setup.bat` script when you first built the GDK for Unreal module dependencies.  The binary takes manually-defined schema and generates Unreal C++ types and an interface for sending and registering callbacks for worker instances to receive SpatialOS component updates.</br></br> **Flags:** </br>Both flags are defined relative to the project root.</br> * `<schema_directory>` is a subdirectory of the `spatial\schema` folder;  you manually create this folder and the schema files in it when you set up non-Unreal server-worker types - these are not schema files generated by the GDK. </br> * `<output_code_directory>` is an output directory created for the code generated by the binary and should be inside your `Source` directory.|
