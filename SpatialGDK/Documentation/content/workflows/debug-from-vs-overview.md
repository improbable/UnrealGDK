# Debug workers from Visual Studio: Overview

You can debug a server-worker type or a game client direct from Visual Studio (VS). You donâ€™t need to leave VS to start up your Unreal Editor to run a worker instance in a local deployment; you can add debug command arguments to VS to run your Unreal Editor in the background and this then runs an instance of the server-worker or game client you are working on.

There are two steps to get this ready:

### 1. Set up your server-workers to auto-start

* See: [Auto-start server-workers in a local deployment]({{urlRoot}}/content/workflows/autostart-server-workers). 

### 2. Set up Visual Studio for debugging

* See: [Set up Visual Studio for debugging]({{urlRoot}}/content/workflows/set-up-vs).
