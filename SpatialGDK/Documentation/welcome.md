<br/>

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is a <a href="" data-track-link="Plugin Link Clicked|product=Docs|platform=Win|label=Win" target="_blank">plugin (Unreal documentation)</a>  which allows you to host your game and combine multiple dedicated server instances across one seamless game world, whilst using the Unreal Engine networking API. 

The GDK offers:<br/>

* **Multiserver support:** leveraging our cloud platform [SpatialOS (SpatialOS documentation)](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos), the GDK allows you to run multiple game servers in a single game instance so your Unreal-developed games can have more players, more Actors, and better gameplay systems than previously possible.<br/>
* **An Unreal-native experience:** keeping traditional workflows and networking APIs that Unreal Engine developers are familiar with, the GDK introduces new native-feeling concepts that turn a single-authority engine into a distributed one. This enables the GDK to retain the functionality of the networking features which Unreal offers out of the box, including transform synchronization, character movement controller, client-side prediction.<br/>
* **An easy way to get started:** we have made sure itâ€™s easy to get started with the GDK by including a Starter Project which you can use as a tour of SpatialOS and a base for your own game, as well as a guide to porting your current multiplayer Unreal game to run on SpatialOS.
