<%(Callout  message="The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal is in alpha. It is ready to use for development of games using a single Unreal server. It it not yet recommended for development of multiserver games, and is not ready for public releases. For more information, please follow our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and [Unreal features support]({{urlRoot}}/unreal-features-support) pages.")%>

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is an Unreal Engine plugin which gives you the features of SpatialOS, within the familiar workflows and APIs of Unreal.

SpatialOS provides:<br/>

* **Global hosting**: Scalable dedicated hosting for your game in every major gaming region.<br/>
* **Easy playtesting**: Deploy and test your game from the start of development, and distribute it to your team and players quickly and easily with a ready-made link.<br/>
* **Profiling and debugging tools**: Logs and metrics out of the box to help you quickly understand any bugs and performance issues.
* **Multiserver networking**: Multiple dedicated servers across one seamless game world, enabling greater numbers of Actors, players and gameplay systems. Note: this feature is currently in preview as we work to improve its stability - we recommend you try it out using the Multiserver Shooter Tutorial, but avoid development with it. 

## Get started

If you’re an Unreal game developer and you’re ready to try out the GDK, follow the [Get started]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction) guide.

It takes you through setting up the GDK and getting the Starter Template project or the Example 
Project running in the cloud, as well as running locally on your computer. This gives an overview of the GDK and using SpatialOS, and you can use the Starter Template as a basis for your own projects.

After you set up the SpatialOS GDK Starter Template or the Example 
Project, you can learn more about the GDK’s functionality with:

* **The tutorial on multiple deployments for session-based games**: upload a session-based FPS example game to the cloud.
* **The Multiserver Shooter tutorial**: implement shooting across the boundaries of different servers simulating one game world.
* **The Porting guide**: porting your existing UE project to SpatialOS.
