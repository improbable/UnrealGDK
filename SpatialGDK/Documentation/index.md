# Welcome to the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Alpha
<%(Callout type="warn" message=" The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal is in alpha. Its API may change as we learn from feedback. Although not fully ready in terms of performance, stability and documentation, this is a great time to get involved with the GDK and shape it with us. We are committed to improving the GDK rapidly, aiming for a more stable release in Q2 2019: see [Development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1). If you are interested in developing with the GDK before then, please contact us via our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/), or [Discord](https://discord.gg/vAT7RSU).")%>

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is a plugin which allows you to host your game and combine multiple dedicated server instances across one seamless game world, whilst using the Unreal Engine networking API. 

The GDK offers:<br/>

* **Multiserver support:** leveraging our cloud platform, the GDK enables you to use more than one Unreal game server in a single instance so that games can have more players, Actors, and gameplay systems than previously possible. <br/>
* **An Unreal-native experience:** keeping traditional workflows and networking APIs that Unreal Engine developers are familiar with, the GDK introduces new native-feeling concepts that turn a single-server engine into a distributed one. This enables the GDK to retain the functionality of the networking features which Unreal offers out of the box, including transform synchronization, character movement, and map travel.<br/>
* **An easy way to get started:** we have made sure it’s easy to [get started]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction) with the GDK by including a Starter Template which you can use as a tour of SpatialOS and a base for your own game, as well as a guide to porting your current multiplayer Unreal game to run on SpatialOS.

## What next?

#### Want to get going with SpatialOS?

* **[Get started]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/introduction) with the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal.** If you’re an Unreal game developer and you're ready to get started with SpatialOS, the _Get started_ guide takes you through setting up the SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork and the GDK. (Note that the GDK is aimed at users comfortable with programming in Unreal.)
