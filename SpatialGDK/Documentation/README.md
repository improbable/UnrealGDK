# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal (alpha) documentation on GitHub

This documentation on GitHub is a copy of the [GDK documentation on the SpatialOS documentation website](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest). Due to this, the internal links do not work and the image links are broken. 

We recommend you use the GDK documentation on the SpatialOS documentation website and not on GitHub.
