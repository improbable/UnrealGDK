/**
 * This test tests RepNotifies and shadow data implementation.
 *
 * The test includes 1 Server and 2 Client workers.
 * The flow is as follows:
 * - Setup:
 *	- The test itself is used as the test Actor.
 *  - It contains a number of replicated properties and OnRep functions that either set boolean flags confirming they have been called, or
 *save the old value of the argument passed to the OnRep function.
 * We also check the ordering of RepNotifies being called, expecting that both an actor and its subobjects will have their new data applied
 *before repnotifies are called on either.
 *
 * - Test:
 *	- The Server changes the values of the replicated properties multiple times.
 *  - The clients check whether the RepNotifies have or have not been called correctly.
 * - Cleanup:
 *	- None.

	 *
	 * To test this, we update a replicated property on our actor and a subobject of that actor.
	 * Then in repnotifies on both the actor and the subobject, we check that the property on the other object has already been updated.
	 *
	 * We also check that the actor's RepNotify was called before the subobject's RepNotify, along with ensuring members are called in the
	 * correct repindex-based order.
