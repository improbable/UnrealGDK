/**
 * This test tests if the movement of a character from a starting point to a Destination, performed on a client, is correctly replicated on the server and on all other clients.
 * Note: The Destination is a TriggerBox spawned locally on each connected worker, either client or server. 
 *		 This test requires the CharacterMovementTestGameMode, trying to run this test on a different game mode will fail.
 *
 * The test includes a single server and two client workers. The client workers begin with a PlayerController and a TestCharacterMovement
 *
 * The flow is as follows:
 * - Setup:
 *    - The server and each client create a TriggerBox locally.
 *    - The server checks if the clients received a TestCharacterMovement and sets their position to (0.0f, 0.0f, 50.0f) for the first client and (100.0f, 300.0f, 50.0f) for the second.
 *    - The client with ID 1 moves its character as an autonomous proxy towards the Destination.
 *  - Test:
 *     - The owning client asserts that his character has reached the Destination.
 *     - The server asserts that client's 1 character has reached the Destination on the server.
 *     - The second client checks that client's 1 character has reached the Destination.
 *  - Cleanup:
 *     - The trigger box is destroyed from all clients and servers
