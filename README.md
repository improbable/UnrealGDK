# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Plugin

![](SpatialGDK/Documentation/spatialos-gdkforunreal-header.png)

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is an Unreal Engine fork and plugin with associated projects. It gives you the features of [SpatialOS](https://documentation.improbable.io/spatialos-overview/docs), within the familiar workflows and APIs of Unreal Engine. For more information, please see the GDK's [documentation website](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unreal/docs).

This is the repository for the GDK plugin, which includes the Starter Template (a blank starter project).

In addition to the plugin, the GDK also includes:

* [The SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine)

    You must be a member of the [Epic Games organization](https://github.com/EpicGames) on GitHub to access this. If you aren't, the link returns a 404 error.
* [The Example Project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject)
  
If you’re an Unreal game developer and you’re ready to try out the GDK, follow the [Get started guide](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unreal/docs/get-started-introduction). 

## SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single-server engine to a distributed model, we made a number of small changes to Unreal Engine code. We are attempting to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in the [SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork repository](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine).

> In order to get access to this fork, you need to link your GitHub account to a verified Epic Games account, and to have agreed to Epic's license. You will not be able to use the GDK for Unreal without doing this first. To do this, see the [Unreal documentation](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).

## Recommended use
To understand the feature-completeness, stability, performance, and support levels you can expect from the GDK, see the [product maturity lifecycle page](https://documentation.improbable.io/gdk-for-unreal/docs/product-maturity-lifecycle).
