# The SpatialOS Unreal GDK readme (pre-alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS and Unreal GDK community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the Unreal GDK, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/311273633307951114/339471548647866368) or talk to us on the **Feedback** section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the **unreal-gdk** tag - [this link](https://forums.improbable.io/new-topic?category=Feedback&tags=unreal-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag).

#### What's the Unreal GDK all about?
The **SpatialOS Unreal GDK** is an Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) module made by Improbable. You can use the Unreal GDK to integrate persistent multiplayer worlds into your Unreal game using the SpatialOS platform.

* Version: pre-alpha (for evaluation only)

## Recommended use
Since the GDK is in pre-alpha, expect that everything can change. Our priority is to react to feedback and iterate quickly. This means that we won't have a deprecation cycle for APIs and workflows for now.

Moreover, some aspects of the GDK are unoptimized so we can't yet recommend it for a game in production stage. We recommend to only start using the GDK if:
* You want to be an early adopter and don't mind the rough edges and you are interested in directly or indirectly contributing to the GDK.
- You want to start evaluating or prototyping for a long term project.

"Although every feature you need to build your optimal game may not be ready yet, this is a great time to get involved and shape the Unreal GDK for what you want to see. We are committed to improving the GDK very rapidly, aiming for an alpha release in September.

## Roadmap

See the [latest roadmap (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/7wtbtwmL/unreal-gdk-roadmap) and let us know what you'd like to see in there.

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we had to make a small number of changes to UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo, `4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK` branch](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine/tree/4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK). <br/>
