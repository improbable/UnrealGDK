# The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal Plugin

![](SpatialGDK/Documentation/spatialos-gdkforunreal-header.png)

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is an Unreal Engine fork and plugin with associated projects. It gives you the features of [SpatialOS](https://ims.improbable.io/products/spatialos), within the familiar workflows and APIs of Unreal Engine. 

**This is the repository for the last version of the GDK plugin that is compatible with the SpatialOS legacy platform**. The GDK is frozen for users who have not yet migrated their project to SpatialOS running on zeuz. 

* If you have a current project using the SpatialOS GDK for Unreal and would like to discuss migrating your project to SpatialOS running on zeuz, please contact us at migration@improbable.io before the 30th December 2021. 

* If you would like to start development of your game on SpatialOS and would like access to the latest version of the GDK for Unreal, please contact us at [ims.improbable.io/contact](https://ims.improbable.io/contact) with details about your project.

## About the GDK
In addition to the plugin, the GDK also includes:

* [The SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine)

   You must be a member of the [Epic Games organization](https://github.com/EpicGames) on GitHub to access this. If you aren't, the link returns a 404 error.

* [The Example Project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKExampleProject)
  
If youâ€™re an Unreal game developer and wish to get access please contact us at [ims.improbable.io/contact](https://ims.improbable.io/contact) with details about your project.

## SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single-server engine to a distributed model, we made a number of small changes to Unreal Engine code. You can see the changes in the [SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork repository](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine).

In order to get access to this fork, you need to link your GitHub account to a verified Epic Games account, and to have agreed to Epic's license. You will not be able to use the GDK for Unreal without doing this first. To do this, see the [Unreal documentation](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).

## Documentation
Find high-level documentation about SpatialOS and the GDKs at [networking.docs.improbable.io](networking.docs.improbable.io). If you wish to get full access to the documentation please contact us at [ims.improbable.io/contact](https://ims.improbable.io/contact) with details about your project.
