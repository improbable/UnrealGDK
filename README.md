# The SpatialOS Unreal GDK readme (pre-alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS and Unreal GDK community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the Unreal GDK, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/311273633307951114/339471548647866368) or talk to us on the **Feedback** section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the **unreal-gdk** tag - [this link](https://forums.improbable.io/new-topic?category=Feedback&tags=unreal-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag). You can also [sign up for SpatialOS Unreal GDK updates](http://go.pardot.com/l/169082/2018-06-15/27ld2t) direct to your mailbox.

#### What's the Unreal GDK all about?
The **SpatialOS Unreal GDK** is an Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) module made by Improbable. You can use the Unreal GDK to integrate persistent multiplayer worlds into your Unreal game using the SpatialOS platform.

## Recommended use
We are releasing the GDK in [pre-alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) so we can react to feedback and iterate on development quickly. To facilitate this, during our pre-alpha stage we don't have a formal deprecation cycle for APIs and workflows. This means that everything and anything can change. In addition, documentation is limited and some aspects of the GDK are not optimized.

Given this, we don’t recommend using the the Unreal GDK for games in the production phase just yet.

**Who is it for?**<br>
We recommend you start using the GDK if:
* You don’t mind the rough edges and are interested in contributing to the GDK (see our [contributions](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) policy).
* You want to start evaluating the GDK or prototyping on it for a future project.

Although every feature you need to build your optimal SpatialOS game may not be ready yet, this is a great time to get involved and shape the Unreal GDK. We are committed to improving the GDK rapidly, aiming for an alpha release in Autumn 2018.

## Unreal Engine changes
In order to transform Unreal from a single server engine to a distributed model, we had to make a small number of changes to UE4 code. We will attempt to consolidate and remove (or submit as PR to Epic) as many of these changes as possible. You can see the changes in our forked [Unreal Engine repo, `4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK` branch](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine/tree/4.19-SpatialOSUnrealGDK).
