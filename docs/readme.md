# SpatialOS Unreal GDK documentation

#### Warning
This [pre-alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) release of the GDK Core is for evaluation and feedback purposes only, with limited documentation - see the guidance on [Recommended use](../README.md#recommended-use).

#### How to get started
We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide](setup-and-installing.md) to set up the Unreal GDK, the SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork, and the Sample Game. You can then explore what the Unreal GDK Core does from there. Use the [Unreal GDK: Contents](#contents) documentation, listed below, to explore how the GDK Core works.

Note that the Unreal GDK documentation assumes that you are familiar with SpatialOS concepts and Unreal concepts.

We want your feedback on the Unreal GDK, its documentation and its [roadmap (Trello board)](TODO add link) - see [Give us feedback](../README.md#give-us-feedback).
