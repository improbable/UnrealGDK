# SpatialOS Unreal GDK documentation

#### Warning
This [pre-alpha](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/release-policy#maturity-stages) release of the GDK Core is for evaluation and feedback purposes only, with limited documentation - see the guidance on [Recommended use](../README.md#recommended-use).

#### How to get started
We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide](setup-and-installing.md) to set up the Unreal GDK, the SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork, and the Starter Project (or your own Unreal project).

After you've run through the setup guide (including setting up Actor replication), we recommend you have a look at the following pages, which explain some of the things that relate to working with SpatialOS:

* [Interop Code Generator](content/interop.md)   
* [Actor handover](content/actor-handover.md)

We want your feedback on the Unreal GDK, its documentation and its [roadmap (Trello board)](TODO add link) - see [Give us feedback](../README.md#give-us-feedback).

## Documentation
