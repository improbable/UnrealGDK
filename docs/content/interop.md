# Interop Code Generator (ICG)

The Interop Code Generator (ICG) is part of the SpatialOS Unreal GDK toolbar. It takes a set of Unreal classes and generates routing code (called ["type bindings"](./glossary.md#type-bindings)) that enables automated communication between Unreal and SpatialOS.

The ICG creates SpatialOS `.schema` files from `UObject` class layouts via Unreal's reflection system (a system in Unreal for programs to self-examine). See the Unreal website’s blog on [the reflection system](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-property-system-reflection) and SpatialOS [documentation on schema](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/shared/schema/introduction).

The `.schema` files enable SpatialOS to understand and store Unreal data. The ICG also creates `SpatialTypeBinding` classes (known as [type bindings](./glossary.md#type-bindings”)).

These classes:
* convert entity property updates to and from SpatialOS in the form of [component updates](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/csharpsdk/using/sending-data#sending-and-receiving-component-updates).
* send and receive Unreal RPCs (remote procedure calls) via [SpatialOS commands](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.1/shared/design/commands).
* have logic to handle conditional replication based on Unreal Actor ownership.

> [Known Issue](../known-issues.md): the ICG is not optimized.

## Running the Interop Code Generator (ICG)

### When to use the ICG
You need to use the ICG to generate `.schema` files and type bindings for any new native class or new Blueprint class that you want to replicate (for simplicity we’ll call these “user-defined classes”) representing new features in your game.

### How to use the ICG
As the Interop Code Generator is an plugin for the Unreal toolbar, to use it you must first:
*  build your game project to access the SpatialOS fork of Unreal Engine as well as the Unreal GDK. (You do this as part of the [installation and setup](../setup-and-installing.md), swapping the “Starter Project” and its file location for your game’s name and file location.)
* set up a `DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini` file. See  [Setting up the Interop Code Generator](#Setting-up-the-Interop-Code-Generator), below.

The SpatialOS build of Unreal has an **Interop Codegen** button; on the SpatialOS Unreal GDK toolbar, select **Interop Codegen** to trigger the ICG process:

## Setting up the Interop Code Generator

In order for the ICG to run correctly, you need to add any new user-defined class, along with its dependencies, to a `DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini` file before you run it.

Using the Unreal GDK Starter Project as an example, to do this:
1. Locate the `DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini` file in the Starter Project repository which you cloned during installation and setup - it’s at `Game/Config/DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini`.
1. Open the file in your editor and add your user-defined class as shown in the file snippet and file description below.

### Example file snippet
In the example file snippet below, your game is `ExampleGame` and the class you want to add is `ExampleGameMyClass`.

```
[InteropCodeGen.Settings]
OutputPath=ExampleGame/Generated/

[InteropCodeGen.ClassesToGenerate]
;ClassName=include_path.h
;Leave empty if no includes required.

;MyClass
ExampleGameMyClass=ExampleGameMyClass.h
ExampleGameMyClass=IncludePath/MyClassDependency.h
```

### Example file description
The  `DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini` file has two sections:
* `InteropCodeGen.Settings`
* `InteropCodeGen.ClassesToGenerate`

**`InteropCodeGen.Settings`**<br/>
In the  `InteropCodeGen.Settings` section you specify where the generated code goes.<br/>
Make sure you list the `OutputPath=` relative to the `source` directory of your game.


So, in the example above:

```
[InteropCodeGen.Settings]
OutputPath=ExampleGame/Generated/
```

**`InteropCodeGen.ClassesToGenerate`**<br/>
The `InteropCodeGen.ClassesToGenerate` section contains a list of the classes you want the ICG to create `.schema` and type bindings for.

The section also contains the dependencies these classes require. These dependencies are an `#include` which the ICG adds to its generated code, so you need to make sure you list all the dependencies the classes need.

In the example above, this is:

```
;MyClass
ExampleGameMyClass=ExampleGameMyClass.h
ExampleGameMyClass=Dependencies/MyClassDependency.h
```

The [Unreal GDK Starter Project’s](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKStarterProject)  `DefaultEditorSpatialGDK.ini` file contains the following:<br/>

```
;PlayerController
StarterProjectPlayerController=StarterProjectPlayerController.h
StarterProjectPlayerController=Camera/CameraAnim.h
StarterProjectPlayerController=Camera/CameraShake.h
StarterProjectPlayerController=GameFramework/HUD.h
StarterProjectPlayerController=GameFramework/LocalMessage.h
StarterProjectPlayerController=Particles/EmitterCameraLensEffectBase.h

;PlayerCharacter
PlayerCharacter=Weapons/Weapon.h
PlayerCharacter=Items/Item.h
```

This generates the appropriate `.schema` files and type bindings as `SpatialTypeBinding` files. Using the Starter Project example:

* The generated `.schema` files are in the Starter Project repository. They are at `<project root>/spatial /schema/improbable/generated/`.
The `.schema` files have names relevant to the class name you give them. From the Starter Project example above: `StarterProjectPlayerController.Schema` and `PlayerCharacter.schema`.

    Some `.schema` files have a `Types` tag;  in this situation `PlayerCharacter.schema` files have the filename `PlayerCharacterTypes.schema`.  This indicates this is a schema containing RPC types which child or sibling classes can reuse.

* The generated `SpatialTypeBinding` files are in the [Unreal GDK repository](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK) at `<Project Root>/workers/unreal/Game/source/GameName/Generated/`.

### Editing the Interop Code Generator tool
If you edit the Interop Code Generator tool itself, you might wish to delete the ICG generated folders as they can cause compilation issues if any of your changes introduce badly generated code.
