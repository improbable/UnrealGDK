# Unreal GDK directory structure
The table below contains the contents of the built Unreal GDK after running `ci/build.bat`.

| Directory | Purpose
|-----------|---------
| `Binaries/ThirdParty/Improbable/` | (Not tracked in git) This folder contains all binaries required for your game project with the Unreal GDK. These files are generated by `ci/build.bat`.
| `build/` | (Not tracked in git) Intermediate folder used for intermediate steps while running `ci/build.bat`.
| `ci/` | Contains the CI build scripts required to build the Unreal GDK.
| `linting/` | Contains the linting scripts required to build the Unreal GDK.
| `docs` | Contains the documentation for the Unreal GDK.
| `fastbuild` | Contains files related to installing FASTBuild. **Note** these currently only work for Improbable engineers.
| `packages/` | (Not tracked in git) Contains the dependencies for building the old Unreal SDK codegen.
| `Plugins/SpatialGDK/SpatialGDKEditorToolbar/` | The Unreal GDK UE4 editor toolbar containing the interop codegen. (See [GenerateInteropCodeCommandlet](#generateinteropcodecommandlet).)
| `schema` | Contains the schemas required when the GDK interacts with SpatialOS.
| `Scripts/` | Contains a set of helper scripts used to build a GDK worker.
| `Source/Programs/` | Contains the forked version of the [GitHub-hosted Unreal SDK code generator](https://github.com/improbable/unified-unreal-sdk/tree/master/Source/Programs/Improbable.Unreal.CodeGeneration).
| `Source/SpatialGDK/Legacy/` | Contains the forked source code from the [GitHub-hosted Unreal SDK](https://github.com/improbable/unified-unreal-sdk/tree/master/Source/SpatialOS).
| `Source/SpatialGDK/Legacy/Deprecated/` | Contains the forked source code from the [GitHub-hosted Unreal SDK](https://github.com/improbable/unified-unreal-sdk/tree/master/Source/SpatialOS) that the GDK does not depend on. This is present purely for backwards compatibility.
| `Source/SpatialGDK/Public/WorkerSdk/` | (Not tracked in git) Contains the [C++ worker SDK](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/cppsdk/introduction) headers. You install these when you run `ci/build.bat`
